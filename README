Heya! This is just the README. I'm not gonna include essential information in here since it's not necessary, so definitely
don't read this if you don't want to. Anyways, for those who are still reading, thank you! This is my first project, and I'll
be amazed if I ever finish this, because at the moment (21/2/2025) I'm running into so many errors and considering stopping the
development. If I do however decide to continue developing, I'll most likely make other even more advanced mods once I get the hang of
developing complicated stuff. To be honest, why are furnaces so hard to make? ðŸ˜­ It just won't work. I'll probably read this in the
future and either cry about it or laugh so hard because damn, I'm stupid. Welp this is about it ig. Have a good day!
